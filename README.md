# TCAV4OCT
Robust and Interpretable CNNs for Glaucoma Detection from OCT Images

Code and Scripts for robust end-to-end deep learning models and interpretabilty analysis using Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAVs, Been Kim, et al.) and corroboration with expert eye tracking, as described in paper: "Robust and Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks to Detect Glaucoma in Optical Coherence Tomography Images."
